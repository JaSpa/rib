description: What is, and *why* use, Rib?
---

Rib was designed to use *existing* tools instead of reinventing them while giving the
user full permission to compose them as they wish, instead of forcing any
particular framework.

### Nix

Rib is best used with [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/); Nix makes it dead-easy
to create reproducible dev environments---a Haskell one in our case. You do not
necessarily have to use Nix for working with Rib sites, but rib provides
necessary Nix expressions to make your job easier.
