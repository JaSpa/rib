description: A short summary of the recent years

I immigrated to Western Canada in 2008 (and then to Quebec in 2017) because I
preferred living in a liberal culture (eg: no more [arranged
marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage_in_the_Indian_subcontinent))
and being surrounded by more interesting tech culture.

As a new immigrant I started off rather gullible; I believed that I would
automatically be part of the new culture and therefore would go through the
self-same experiences of a native born resident. Actual life experiences over
the years indicated otherwise, which twigged me to gain more understanding of
human groups and the nature of belonging.

I now very much relate to the perpetual state of remaining a foreigner \(as

"_I refuse to give up being a foreigner_"\) which presents a freedom to not have
to force oneself to fit in with some group.

I appreciate living in a safe place, with liberal attitudes, and good standard of
living with pleasant weather. As long as people follow the laws, social
protocols and treat their fellow humans with consideration not having to expect
anything socially is greatly liberating.

Becoming free of the need to belong means that I am getting closer to [becoming
